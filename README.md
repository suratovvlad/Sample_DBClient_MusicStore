# Sample DB Client "Music Store"
It is study project I wrote several years ago. Don't see the codebase - 
it is awful and very strange.
Just press back button and see other repos.

This application is simple client for SQL Database (MySQL) of 
music store. 

## Check
1. Setup MySQL.
2. Compile mysql driver for your version of Qt.
3. Fill the DB by scripts.
4. Try to compile the project.
5. Try to run it and check the app.
